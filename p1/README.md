## Notes for instructor
I decided not get fancy with styles or a canvas and opted for text only to represent the organisms being alive or dead. This also maximizes the use of the observable 2D array I am using to represent the game board. Converting to using vue was a lot more simple than I originally thought and without any canvas, the board is displayed very quickly.

Hint: click the `Add Random` button a few times to make it more interesting. Also - try adding an oscillator which looks something like this:
```
. . * . . 

. . * . . 

. . * . . 
```

or this...
